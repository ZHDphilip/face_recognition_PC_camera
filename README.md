# face_recognition_PC_camera
1: This is a 100% just-for-fun project while I am self-studying Python and Opencv.

2: This Project used the python face_recognition Library, which is not a completely accurate one.
   So feel free to leave your comments, I truely appreciate them.
  
3: When this project is run, two .json files will be created to hold information about new faces 
   and associated names.
   
4: When a window pops out and ask you for your name, simply type it in and close the window 
   manually.
   
5: Don't worry, your photo and name will be kept confidential (stored only on your device, and 
   under the same directory as the .py) and will not be uploaded to any individual or web-
   database.
